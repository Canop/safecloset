# SafeCloset ${version}

SafeCloset is written by Denys Séguret. Source code and documentation can be found on *https://dystroy.org/safecloset/*

SafeCloset stores secrets in drawers. A drawer may be either top-level, or hidden in another drawer. Each drawer is protected by a passphrase.

SafeCloset leaves after 120 seconds of inactivity.

## Keyboard actions

The *^* symbol in SafeCloset means that the *control* key must be pressed.
